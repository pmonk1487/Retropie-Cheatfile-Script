# Retropie Cheatfile Script
Quick and dirty script to create .cht files.  <br>
I ran into small frustrations when adding cheats to files and making my own. <br>
This won't add cheats to an existing file, but it made it quicker for me to create new files. <br>
If this helps anyone, I'm glad. <br>
Also, make sure you add .cht to the filename when it ask you for it.<br>
It's not vital, but it saves you from adding it later.<br>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: It shouldn't do any harm to any of your devices, but use at your own risk.  <br>
It doesn't check if it is overwriting files. <br>
You're on your own to make sure you don't write over anything important.<br>
I keep it in a separate folder since I have it create files within its folder.<br>
